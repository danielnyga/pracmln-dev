This project is basically a ROS Service that can be used
to query a Markov Logic Network. One may train an MLN
and store it to a *.mln file before parsing it as an
argument to the request.

/msg
/AtomProbPair is basically a tuple that stores an
atom-probability pair.

/MLNResponse is an array of AtomProbPairs

/MLNQuery is a message for representing all the arguments
that are needed to successfully query an MLN.
